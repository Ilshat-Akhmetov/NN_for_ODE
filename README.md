# Solving ODE using Neural Netwrork

This mini-project's purpose in to demonstrate neural networks capabilities
for solving ordinary differential equations. The program is apllicable for Cauchi problem as well 
as for boundary value problem. 

In jupyter-notebook file named as Solving_ODE_with_NN_Presentation.ipynb  you
may found various examples of application NN to ODE with comparison of analytical solution.

Most of the project was developed in Pycharm, so Jupyter-Notebook file
uses imported scripts.

Similarly to provided examples you can also try it on other ODEs.
